# Memory Optimization Guide for Researcher Electron App

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive memory optimization strategies implemented to reduce Electron memory usage from 300MB-1000MB to target ranges of 200MB-500MB.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Electron Configuration Optimizations

#### Hardware Acceleration Disabled
- `app.disableHardwareAcceleration()` - Disables GPU acceleration
- `--disable-gpu` - Disables GPU processes completely
- `--disable-gpu-sandbox` - Removes GPU sandbox overhead
- `--disable-gpu-compositing` - Disables GPU compositing
- `--disable-gpu-rasterization` - Disables GPU rasterization

#### Chromium Feature Disabling
- `--disable-background-timer-throttling` - Prevents background throttling
- `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows` - Keeps windows active
- `--disable-renderer-backgrounding` - Prevents renderer backgrounding
- `--disable-extensions` - Disables extension system
- `--disable-plugins` - Disables plugin system
- `--disable-sync` - Disables sync services
- `--disable-background-networking` - Disables background networking

#### Memory Management
- `--max_old_space_size=512` - Limits V8 heap to 512MB
- `--memory-pressure-off` - Disables memory pressure handling
- `--disable-dev-shm-usage` - Disables shared memory usage
- `--no-sandbox` - Disables sandbox for memory savings

### 2. BrowserWindow Optimizations

#### Main Window
- Memory limit: 512MB
- Background throttling enabled
- Experimental features disabled
- Remote module disabled

#### Child Windows
- Memory limit: 256MB
- Same optimization settings as main window
- Reduced memory allocation for secondary windows

### 3. Runtime Memory Management

#### Garbage Collection
- Automatic garbage collection every 30 seconds
- High memory usage triggers (800MB+ RSS, 400MB+ heap)
- Forced cleanup on window close
- Final cleanup on app exit

#### Memory Monitoring
- Real-time memory usage logging
- Process memory tracking
- Automatic cleanup recommendations

### 4. Build Optimizations

#### Vite Configuration
- Terser minification with aggressive settings
- Console log removal in production
- Source map disabling
- Chunk splitting for better caching
- Dependency optimization

#### Bundle Optimization
- Vendor chunk separation
- TipTap extension bundling
- Utility library separation

## Usage

### Memory Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor memory usage continuously
npm run memory:monitor

# Check current memory status
npm run memory:status

# View optimization recommendations
npm run memory:recommendations
```

### Development
```bash
# Start development with optimizations
npm run dev

# Build optimized production version
npm run build
```

## Expected Results

### Before Optimization
- Startup: 300MB
- Operation: 1000MB+
- High GPU process usage
- Background services running

### After Optimization
- Startup: 150-200MB (50% reduction)
- Operation: 300-500MB (50-70% reduction)
- No GPU processes
- Minimal background services

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
1. Monitor memory usage with `npm run memory:status`
2. Check for memory leaks in React components
3. Review console logs for memory warnings
4. Restart application if memory exceeds 800MB

### Performance Indicators
- Memory usage below 500MB during normal operation
- Smooth scrolling and editing experience
- Fast startup time (< 3 seconds)
- Responsive UI interactions

## Troubleshooting

### High Memory Usage
1. Check for multiple Electron processes
2. Verify no background services are running
3. Restart the application
4. Check for memory leaks in React components

### Performance Issues
1. Ensure hardware acceleration is disabled
2. Check memory limits are properly set
3. Verify garbage collection is running
4. Monitor for excessive DOM nodes

### Build Issues
1. Verify Vite configuration is correct
2. Check Terser minification settings
3. Ensure chunk splitting is working
4. Verify source maps are disabled in production

## Advanced Optimizations

### Future Improvements
1. Implement virtual scrolling for large documents
2. Add Web Worker support for heavy computations
3. Implement lazy loading for TipTap extensions
4. Add memory leak detection tools
5. Implement document compression

### React-Specific Optimizations
1. Use React.memo for expensive components
2. Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
3. Avoid creating objects in render functions
4. Use useCallback and useMemo appropriately
5. Implement component lazy loading
